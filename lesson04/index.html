          <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

          <p>I work as a full time graphic designer at a full service advertising agency. In my spare time, I am taking graphic design classes. Since I am self-taught, I want to learn and absorb as much as I can. A goal of mine is to broaden my knowledge and become proficient in HTML and CSS. I want to open as many doors of opportunity as I can when it comes to graphic design.</p>

            <h3><em><strong>Map of Raleigh, North Carolina</strong></em></h3>
            <p>I created this map of Raleigh in my Computer Design Tech class at Wake Tech Community College. I used Adobe Illustrator to create all of the elements. I wanted to create a simple yet striking map that highlighted a lot of Raleigh's wonderful landmarks such as the North Carolina Museum of Art and PNC Arena.</p>

            <p>This is a a project I created in one of my first classes at Wake Tech, Computer Design Basics. I was tasked with creating a label for a beverage of my choosing. As an avid coffee lover, I decided to create a label for a Cold Brew coffee named Coffeebee.</p>
